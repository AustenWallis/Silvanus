# Silvanus

Silvanus is a systematic training program to uncover, test and execute methods.
The program is built to call on Alpha Vantage's API with aims to extend this to 
the bloomberg terminal in due course.

A number of files are hidden from the repository to keep certain ideas, keys and
strategies secret. The data folder is also hidden to not take up a huge volume
of storage space up on github. 

Aim is to:

1) Build a system for easily calling data from AV's API
2) Produce a GUI stock visualisation system and a more raw plotting tool selection. 
3) Develop methods based in the ideas.ipynb notebook. 
4) Easy hypothesis backtesting facilities functions. 
5) Develop a live-trading script to interact with trading account based on real-time data.
6) Learn a lot about programming, maths, optimisation and applying astro knowledge.
7) ...Profit?
8) ʕノ•ᴥ•ʔノ ︵ ┻━┻

Austen ... Aim to develop this as fast as physically possible, don't reinvent the wheel.
Effective, fast solutions are key. Experiment with new tools and packages first instead of 
just practicing what you already know.
