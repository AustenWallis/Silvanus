3 stage to building models:

1) Alpha generating strategies
  -Trend Following or Mean reversion main methods
  -QLS. Taking long and short positions to different priced instruments depending upon whether they are 'cheaply' or 'expensively' priced.
  -Higher yielding priced instruments 
  -Needing good liquidity for fairer priced movements
  -Empirical or hypothetical modelling. Based off data or a theory.
2) Risk Model behaviour
  -Check your group of assets don't co-vary with each other or your downside risk will be significantly elevated.
  -Reduce leverage depending on the signal strength of your alpha strategy, in turn portfolio size of your position.
  -Apply a function for your size position as a percentage of portfolio to allow for a greater size with stronger signals
3) Transaction Costs
  -Function the greater the market order, the higher the cost of transaction as the liquidity begins to be sucked up
  -Linear/combination linear models easier and quicker to predict/expected cost instead of quadratic. Timing sale price is important. 
  
Portfolio Optimisation:
  -Weigh model instruments by equal weighting, signal strength weighting(not so good), risk weighting(chance of underperformance) and combinations
  -Correlated stocks and reducing the overall portfolio dedicated to a sector so that a single macro swing doesn't affect the whole performance. Equally,       no point having all stocks equally represented as there is no optimisation. 
  -Measures are, mean variance optimisation, Markowitz model and more Chapter 7 'inside the black box'
  
Transaction Orders:
    -Depends on the aggressiveness of the position. Market orders being the most and filling at the quickest possible time. Where losing pennies makes pounds. 
    -The further away from the bid and ask prices in the same direction reduces the aggressiveness until your price can be achieved.
    -A blend of limit order positions can help optimise your aggressiveness and realising profits.
